Custom LZ_COMPRESSION
It's a work in progress... almost got it


GPRS HEADER, 0x08 Bytes
    GPRS, 0x00
    Original size of file {BE}, 0x04

COMPRESSED CHUNKS
    8 flag bits, 8-??? data bytes
    
    FLAG BITS
        0 is raw byte
        1 is destination address + copy counter
            0 is destination address
            1 is constructed destination address
                4 bits from flag (0x0X) added to constructed address
            
            0 is no change to counter
            1 is add following bit from flag (b) to counter
        
        If amount bits greater than remaining data bytes, leave remaining as 0
    
    DATA BYTES
        Flag 0
            Raw is 0xAB
        Flag 1
            Destination Flag 0
                Destination address is 0xFFFFFFAB
            Destination Flag 1
                Destination address is 0xFFFFFABX
            
            Counter starts at 1
            LOOP:
                Counter Flag 0
                    BREAK
                Counter Flag 1
                    Counter * 2 + b
        
            COUNTER < 7:
                LOOP COUNTER + 1 TIMES:
                    Copied from destination address is 0xAB
            COUNTER >= 7:
                Increment counter
                Added index is last 3 bits of counter
                Address to copy to is added index added to address minus 8
                Address to copy from is destination address added to address to copy to
                Bit shift counter right 3
                LOOP:
                    ADDED INDEX == 0:
                        Index is 0
                        Add 8 to address to copy to
                              and address to copy from
                        COUNTER == -1:
                            BREAK
                    ADDED INDEX > 0:
                        Index is last 3 bits of bitswapped added index plus 1
                    LOOP INDEX < 8:
                        (Copied from plus index) to (copied to plus index) is 0xAB
                    Added index is 0
