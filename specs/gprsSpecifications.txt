Custom LZ_COMPRESSION


GPRS HEADER, 0x08 Bytes
    GPRS, 0x00
    Original size of file {BE}, 0x04

COMPRESSED CHUNKS
    8 flag bits
    
    FLAG BITS
        0 is raw byte
        1 is copy address + copy counter
            ADDRESS:
            0 is copy address
            1 is constructed copy address
                4 bits from flag (0x0X) added to constructed address
            
            COUNTER:
            0 is no change to counter
            1 is add following bit from flag (b) to counter
        
        If amount bits greater than remaining data bytes, leave remaining as 0
    
    DATA BYTES
        Flag 0
            Raw is 0xAB
        Flag 1
            Copy Address Flag 0
                Copy address is 0xFFFFFFAB
            Copy Address Flag 1
                Copy address is 0xFFFFFABX - 0xFF
            
            Counter starts at 1
            LOOP:
                Counter Flag 0
                    BREAK
                Counter Flag 1
                    Counter * 2 + b
        
            COUNTER < 7:
                Final copy address is destination address + copy address
                LOOP COUNTER + 1 TIMES:
                    Copied from final copy address is 0xAB
                    Increment final copy address and destination address by 1
                    
            COUNTER >= 7:
                Increment counter
                Added index is last 3 bits of counter
                Destination address is increased by (added index - 8)
                Final copy address is destination address + copy address
                Bit shift counter right 3
                LOOP COUNTER + 1 TIMES:
                    ADDED INDEX == 0:
                        Index is 0
                        Increment final copy address and destination address by 8
                        COUNTER == 0:
                            BREAK
                    ADDED INDEX > 0:
                        Index is last 3 bits of bitswapped added index + 1
                    LOOP INDEX < 8:
                        Copied from (final copy address + index) is 0xAB
                    Added index is 0
